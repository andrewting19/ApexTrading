  <p class="title gradient-text">Welcome to Apex Trading Utopia</p>
  <p>We are a Discord community of likeminded traders and investors. </p>
  <div class="home-desc">
    
    <p>At our server, we strive to promote a level of education, self-improvement, transparency, and community higher than any other stock trading Discord server.</p>
    <p>
      Little known is that the building blocks of consistent profitability are good habits, hard work, and strict rules. 
      We hope to instill these qualities, and the self-discipline to build them, into our members and help them achieve financial freedom.</p>
    <p>We offer a variety of services including options alerts (see <a routerLink="/performance">Performance</a>) but again we want this server to be dedicated to self-improvement,
      where members can thrive after learning how to trade like veterans. 
      </p>
    <p>We don't want people to blindly follow these alerts, but to analyze them and study them. 
      Why enter there? Why exit then? How did they pick key levels? How did they know where to take profit or stop out?
      Study, question, learn and be rewarded.</p>
